# V3.1 WIP
* expose to io.adafruit.com using a few relays ( 120V and 240V via contactor)
* still wip, in another rpi for now

# V3 is live

* We now have internet at the truite!
* push out to io.adafruit.com every 5m
* pulls from the exporter setup in V2 (almost a year of data!)

# V2 is now live. 
Based on Prometheus, grafana and https://github.com/goof15kw/dht-exporter (thanks original authors)

Prometheus.yaml in the root if this repo along with rc.local and a dashboard.json. 

This repo is mainly my backup if the SD goes bad.
